Recently developed a ReactJS web application that tracks real-time cryptocurrency with their rank, current price, and market price, all presented with visually stunning graphical representations of 24 hours, 30 days, 3 months, and 1 year. The UI is easy on the eyes, designed using MaterialUI, and includes several intriguing features such as a table that arranges coins based on their price and market cap, with up to 10 pages available. What's more, users can switch between currencies from rupees to dollars. The data was fetched from CoinGecko API, using ChartJS and GraphJS, to represent charts and graphs for each coin.
